# Highway Network for Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

In this notebook, I explore the implementation of a Highway Network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to leverage the capabilities of a Highway Network, which is a type of neural network architecture that includes special gating mechanisms to control the flow of information through the network.

## Key Components and Concepts:

1. **MNIST Dataset**: Utilize the MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), for training and testing the recognition model.

2. **Highway Network Architecture**: Implement a Highway Network architecture, which includes highway layers with gating mechanisms. These gating mechanisms allow the network to control the flow of information, enabling better learning of features.

3. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the MNIST dataset, including normalization and reshaping, to prepare it for training the neural network.

4. **Model Training**: Train the Highway Network on the MNIST dataset, optimizing the network's parameters to achieve accurate predictions.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the performance of the Highway Network in recognizing handwritten digits.

6. **Visualization**: Visualize the training progress, including accuracy and loss curves, to gain insights into the learning process.

7. **Model Testing**: Test the trained Highway Network on a separate test dataset to evaluate its generalization capabilities.

## Application:

- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: The primary application is to accurately recognize handwritten digits. The Highway Network is expected to capture intricate features in the input images, leading to better recognition performance.

- **Gating Mechanisms**: Explore the effectiveness of gating mechanisms in Highway Networks for controlling information flow and improving the learning process.

- **Model Generalization**: Assess how well the trained model generalizes to new, unseen data, which is crucial for its practical applicability.

By the end of this notebook, the goal is to have a trained Highway Network capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits, demonstrating the advantages of using a Highway Network architecture for this task.
